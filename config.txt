You can add a new theme settings by going onto settings schema .json

{
    "name": "Shopping Cart",
    "settings": [
      {
        "type": "header",
        "content": "Shopping Cart"
      }
    ]
  },


This is the synax to create a header for shopping cart

{
    "name": "Shopping Cart",
    "settings": [
      {
        "type": "header",
        "content": "Shopping Cart"
      },
      {
        "type" : "text",
        "id" : "test_data",
        "label" : "Test Data"
      }
    ]
  },

  This shows a header with Shopping Cart
   but if you click inside it shows a text box with the label test data
   make sure to save after adding the new data point

To write down any data point added you can go to profile.liquid or theme.liquid to add the data 
{{settings.test_data}}

It is also saved in settings_data.json
